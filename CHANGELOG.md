# 0.4.0 (2024-09-13)

New features:

- `ethersync client` now connects to the socket specified in the environment variable `ETHERSYNC_SOCKET`.
- Published extensive user documentation at <https://ethersync.github.io/ethersync/>.
- Published ADR-08 (on secure connections) and ADR-09 (on the data structure for multiple files).
- Support multiple local editors connecting the the same daemon. Caveat: Their initial state needs to be in sync.
- Watch for file creation and modification by external tools in project directory, and forward these changes to the peers.

Bug fixes:

- When peers put something invalid into the "states" key of the CRDT, ignore it.
- Fix bug when inserting text ending with \n after last visible line. This happened, for example, when performing a `echo line >> file`.

# 0.3.0 (2024-08-13)

New features:

- Integrated libp2p for transport encryption and authentication of peers.
- Added a password protection â€“ peers must specify the same `--secret` to connect.
- You can now provide default startup arguments in `.ethersync/config`.

Bug fixes:

- The daemon is now more resilient against misbehaving peers and editors, and won't crash as easily.

# 0.2.2 (2024-08-01)

New features:

- Persist the CRDT to `.ethersync/doc`, so that peers can run independently, and sync back later.
- When restarting the daemon, calculate file diffs since the daemon was last online, and apply them to the CRDT.
- Dynamically create files when they are opened.
- When files are deleted, delete them for all peers.
- Sandbox file I/O to be restricted into the shared project folder.
- The editor plugin can now send JSON-RPC requests and get feedback on whether the intended operation worked or not.

# 0.2.1 (2024-07-26)

New features:

- Share multiple files per directory.
- Transmit cursor positions, and display them in the Neovim plugin.
- Add a Nix flake to the project for simplified installation.
- The "cursor" messages in the editor protocol are no longer revisioned. In practice, this seems to work well enough.

# 0.2.0 (2024-05-02)

Rewrite of the initial prototype in Rust.

# 0.1.0 (2024-01-22)

An initial prototype in Typescript. It only supports sharing a single file.
